# AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINE (ATM) PYTHON

![ATM Python GIF Demonstration](https://github.com/smhussain5/ATM-OOP/blob/main/ATM_OOP_PYTHON.gif?raw=true)

## Problem ðŸ¤”

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a staple in programming and allows for benefits such as abstraction and code readability. The best way to practice OOP is to develop projects.

## Solution ðŸ’¡

This terminal application utilizes OOP to simulate an ATM. Users can input one of several menu options that correlate to specific functions within the ATM class. Functions include depositing into/withdrawing from checking/savings account and transferring between accounts.

## Quick Start âš¡

If you have Docker installed, you can run this application on your own machine with just 2 steps!
<br>
<br>
Pull the image from Docker Hub
```python
docker pull smhussain5/atm-python
```
Then run the image as an interactive Docker container
```python
docker run --rm -it smhussain5/atm-python
```
## Technologies Used âš™

- PyCharm
- Python
  - "Locale" module 

## Challenges ðŸ’¢

This was a straightforward application, but creating the Dockerfile was troublesome. Because the image was based on Linux distribution (Alpine), I needed to update and set the locale to en_US for the locale module and currency formatting to work.

## Insights ðŸ’­

I enjoyed developing this application because I was able to practice OOP. As a result, it showed the importance and benefits of incorporating OOP into my projects. This project could be further refactored by using PyTest to ensure proper validation and functioning.
